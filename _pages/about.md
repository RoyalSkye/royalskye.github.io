Hi, I'm Jianan Zhou! I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Northeastern University ([NEU](http://english.neu.edu.cn)) in 2019, and M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg)) in 2021, where I was supervised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/), and worked as a research intern at [SCALE@NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scale). Now, I am a research assistant at [HKBU](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/) TML group working with [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) and [Dr. Jingfeng Zhang](https://zjfheart.github.io) on Adversarial Learning.

Research
======
My research mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Optimization, especially exploring [learning to search paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06128.pdf), and using Deep Reinforcement Learning to solve Combinatorial Optimization Problem, such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). It is a hot topic for both AI and Operations Research, quite interesting yet challenging. I'm also interested in Weakly Supervised and Robust Machine Learning.
