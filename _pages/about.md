I'm Jianan Zhou, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University ([CCDS@NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing)), supervised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/), and co-supervised by Dr. Chi Xu @ A*STAR. Previously, I received a B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2019, and an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from NTU in 2021. After that, I was a research assistant at HKBU TMLR group, working with [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) on adversarial machine learning with weak supervision.

Research
======

My research mainly focuses on Machine Learning for Optimization, especially exploring the [learning to optimize paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06128.pdf).

* Neural Combinatorial Optimization (2020 - Present)
* Vehicle Routing Problem (2020 - Present)
* Foundation Model for Combinatorial Optimization (2024 - Present)
