Hi! I'm a final-year Ph.D. student in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University ([CCDS@NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing)), where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/) and Dr. Chi Xu. Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2019, and my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from NTU in 2021. After that, I worked as a research assistant at HKBU TMLR group, under the supervision of [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/).

Research
======

My long-term research lies at the intersection of machine learning and optimization, striving to enable automated decision-making with artificial intelligence for complex optimization problems. Central to my research is the field of [Learning to Optimize](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06128.pdf), where advanced machine learning techniques are leveraged to learn deep models capable of assisting in, or directly solving, challenging optimization problems.

During my PhD, my primary research focused on Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), with applications to routing problems (e.g., TSP and VRP). Recently, I have been working on integer programming and exploring the potential of [foundation models for combinatorial optimization](https://github.com/ai4co/awesome-fm4co) in solving CO challenges.
