I'm Jianan Zhou, a Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (SCSE@NTU), supervised by [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/). Previously, I received B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU) in 2019, and M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from NTU in 2021. After that, I was a research assistant at HKBU TML group, working with [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) on adversarial machine learning with weak supervision.

Research
======

My research mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Optimization, especially exploring [learning to optimize paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06128.pdf). I'm also interested in Adversarial Machine Learning.

* Neural Combinatorial Optimization

- Security and Robustness in Machine Learning
