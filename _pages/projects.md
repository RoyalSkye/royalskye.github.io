## 2021

* Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Resource Allocation - Supervised by [Prof Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj/) at [SCALE@NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scale)
  * Designed and developed a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework to solve large-scale Airport Ground Handling (AGH) problems. With the designed destroy heuristic operators, the framework is able to solve real-world instances, which contain millions of variables and complex constraints, within practice time.
  * Learning a LNS framework by Graph Convolutional Network and Imitation Learning to solve large-scale airport ground handling instances from [CHANGI Airport](https://www.changiairport.com).

## 2020

- Kaggle - [Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa) (TOP 15%): used machine learning techniques, including feature engineering, normalization, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, label smoothing, cross validation and ensemble learning, to determine MOA of a drug.
- [Atari-Breakout](https://github.com/RoyalSkye/Atari-DRL): developed different DRL algorithms, such as DQN and A3C, to play Breakout game, and achieved super-human performance.
- [Image Captioning](https://github.com/RoyalSkye/Image-Caption): developed Transformer to generate grammatical correctly and expressional accurately captions for images.
- [Tileworld](https://github.com/RoyalSkye/Tileworld-MAS): built intelligent agents (multi-agent system) for Tileworld environment.
- CelebA Facial Attribute Recognition: identified the attribute label depicted in a facial photograph, and improved the generalization of model by data augmentation and domain adaptation.
- DIV2K Single Image Super-Resolution: improved the results of developed model to increase the resolution of a single image in [MMEditing](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting).

## 2019

* Mineral Grade Information Management System - FYP supervised by [Prof Tao Ren](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/swc/rent/)
  * Designed and implemented a system that is responsible for rock identification and grade intelligent detection based on portable spectrometer, using machine learning techniques, including data decomposition and classification, which are used to handle spectral data with the features of high dimensions and high correlation between adjacent bands.

## 2016 - 2018

* Eight-Puzzle: developed solutions to Eight Puzzle Problem in C++, which used heuristic algorithm as A*, Manhattan distance as h(n) and Cantor expansion as hash value.
* Game Development in Linux: developed a multi-player online game with C in Linux, which used thread callback functions and Socket to implement asynchronous non-blocking I/O and communications between servers and clients.
* JSP and Servlet: Co-developed company internal OA \& portal system based on JSP and Servlet, and used design pattern to facilitate reuse of the code.
